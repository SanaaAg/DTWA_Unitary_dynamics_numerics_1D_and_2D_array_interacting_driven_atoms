# DTWA_Unitary_dynamics_numerics_2D_array_interacting_driven_atoms
   Numerically solves the equations of motion in the Discrete Truncated Wigner Approximation (DTWA) to dynamically evolve a driven 2D array of 2 level atoms interacting via dipolar interactions, which amounts to an inhomogeneous and anisotropic XY model
